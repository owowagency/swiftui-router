/// - For all presented views, the router generates a `RouteViewIdentifier`
/// - The router prepares the environment for the presented views
///
/// As part of the environment preparation, the router should provide the following data to all presented routes:
/// - The router itself
/// - The `VoidObservableObject` instance
/// - The environment object dependency of the presented route
/// - The `RouteViewIdentifier` of the presented route
